# My version of the assignments for the first few courses of The Odin Project

Hi! Thanks for checking out this repository. I'm Mart and already a webdev, but I'd like a bit more practice with structured projects. For example, I almost never wrote vanilla HTML and CSS. That's why I'm taking the course. You can expect some of the projects looking a bit more advanced than beginner level, though ;)
The index.html file links to all the assignments I have done for The Odin Project. Portfolio projects will have their own repository, as will the projects that require React for example (I can't host those on GitHub Pages).
