    <h1>Welcome to my The Odin Project assignment showcase!</h1>
    <p>I took the course to strengthen my core web programming abilities. I like that everything's really structured, but still links to external sources. I have some gaps in my knowledge that I like to fill. That's why I'm taking the course.</p>
    <h2>My experience (as a web developer)</h2>
    <p>I already made a few websites and browser extensions. Most of them aren't on my GitHub, but you can check out <a href="https://github.com/SwiftDust/studymate">StudyMate</a>since that roughly defines what I'm able to do right now:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>being able to write HTML, CSS and TypeScript pretty well</li>
      <li>using a framework (I only know Svelte at the moment)</li>
      <li>writing simple background logic</li>
    </ul>
    <p>also know some TailwindCSS and SQL. I also know the general concept of APIs and how they work but I didn't really write one myself yet.</p>
    
    <p>I hope to learn the following:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Better problem solving skills, asking for help/searching Google, being able to write a website without using AI to help me solve bugs</li>
      <li>Better understanding of CSS and general back-end concepts</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>My completed assignments:</h2>
    <ul>

    <p>By the way, this website will definitely get some styling later :)</p>
