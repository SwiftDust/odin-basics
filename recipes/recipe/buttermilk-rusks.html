    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Buttermilk rusks. Since I first tasted them, I can't live without them anymore. Sadly, they're not widely available in The Netherlands, I have to go to a special South African store to get them :( anyways, those are rusks made from buttermilk, to dip in your coffee or tea, then taste and savour.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 1/2 sticks butter</li>
      <li>2 1/2 cups white sugar</li>
      <li>2 cups buttermilk</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>8 cups self-rising flour</li>
      <li>5 cups granola</li>
      <li>5 teaspoons baking powder</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Grease cake pans. You can use 9x13-inch pans, round cake pans, or loaf pans. </li>
      <li> Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Remove from heat and mix in sugar, buttermilk, and eggs. </li>
      <li> Combine self-rising flour, granola, baking powder, and salt in a bowl. Add to the butter mixture and mix until well combined. Batter will be sloppy. Divide into thirds, and then divide each third into small balls. Place into the prepared cake pans side by side. </li>
      <li> Bake in the preheated oven until cooked fully through, 45 to 60 minutes. Remove from oven and gently place on baking sheets. </li>
      <li> Reduce oven temperature to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C). Bake rusks on low temperature until dry and crunchy, 2 to 3 hours. Depending on the size of your rusks this can take several hours. </li>
    </ol>
