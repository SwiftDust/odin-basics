    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Bobotie is one of my favorite South African dishes. It's a South African traditional beef casserole with custard on top.</p>
    <p>The origin of bobotie is Indonesian and it found its way to South Africa thanks to Dutch traders (the VOC). The ships went from the Netherlands to Indonesia and then South Africa. That explains the combination.</p>
    <p>Yields 8 servings.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
      <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more to taste</li>
      <li>5 teaspoons curry powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>2 pounds ground beef</li>
      <li>4 bay laurel leaves, divided</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon lemon zest</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon wine vinegar or apple cider vinegar, to taste</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
      <li>1/3 cup Indian-style fruit chutney, to taste</li>
      <li>3 slices white bread, crusts removed</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups milk, divided</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <li>Heat olive oil and butter in a large oven-proof skillet over medium heat. Add onions and salt, and cook until just beginning to soften and turn translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. </li>
      <li>Stir in curry powder, cumin, turmeric, black pepper, and oregano, and cook for 1 to 2 minutes more.  </li>
      <li>Add ground beef, and cook, stirring, while breaking the meat up into small crumbles. Add 1 bay leaf, tomato paste, and garlic, and cook, stirring, for another 2 minutes.</li>
      <li>Stir in lemon juice and zest, vinegar, Worcestershire, and chutney. Smooth the top, and simmer mixture gently for 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, add bread to a bowl and cover with 1/2 cup of milk, toss, and let stand for 5 minutes. Squeeze excess milk back into the bowl and add soaked bread to meat. Mash, smash and stir mixture until bread is thoroughly blended in.</li> 
      <li>Add remaining 1 cup milk to the bowl; add eggs, cayenne, and pinch of salt, and whisk thoroughly. Pour gently over meat, and top with 3 or more bay leaves.</li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven until custard on top is set and lightly golden brown, about 45 minutes. Let rest 5 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
