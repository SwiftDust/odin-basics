# Recipes
Very first project of The Odin Project. You can just use basic HTML here to make a recipes page. I've chosen to make one with South African recipes.

## What I learnt:
It was mainly a typing exercise :) but I also learnt Vim since I've chosen that as my editor for the course to still challenge myself a bit!
